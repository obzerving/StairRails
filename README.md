# StairRails
 Inkscape extension that generates the paths for constructing a papercraft staircase and rails

Given the parameters for size and shape, this program makes it easy to construct all the pieces you need to make a staircase for use in Design Space or Silhouette Studio (Designer+ editions)

A YouTube video playlist is available to guide you through the setup, use and assembly. https://tinyurl.com/bde65f5m

Installing:

Copy StairRails.inx and StairRails.py into your Inkscape user extensions directory. Where is that? Open Inkscape and go to the System section of the Preferences menu (Edit --> Preferences --> System). You will find a User extensions item containing the path to your user extensions directory. You can put your files in a folder underneath this directory as well (for instance, "Papercraft")

Usage:

See the file How_to_use_StairRails.pdf for details.



Note:

This extension (for Inkscape version 1.1+) is still under development and the code reflects it. It's functional, but not yet bulletproof, so be mindful of the input constraints in the usage document.
